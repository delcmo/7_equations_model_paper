Please find attached a copy of our manuscript titled ``Application of the reactor system code RELAP-7 to single- and two-phase flow water-hammer problems'' for submission to the {\em special issue of the M\&C 2015 of Nuclear Science and Engineering}.

In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a numerical method called the Entropy Viscosity Method using the system code Relap-7. The Entropy Viscosity Method was initially developed by Guermond et al. and then extended to low-Mach flows by Delchini et al. The work presented in this paper aims at assessing the capabilities of the Entropy Viscosity Method when numerically solving real engineering applications encountered in nuclear reactors.

We consider both single- and two-phase flow models, namely, the single-phase Euler equations and the two-phase flow seven-equation model. After detailing the numerical method, water-hammer tests are presented for single- and two-phase flows.

Thank you for considering this manuscript for publication in the {\it special issue of the M\&C 2015 of Nuclear Science and Engineering}.
