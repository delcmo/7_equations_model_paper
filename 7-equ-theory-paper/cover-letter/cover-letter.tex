Please find attached a copy of our manuscript titled ``Viscous Regularization for the non-equilibrium Seven-Equation Two-Phase Flow Model'' for submission to the {\em Journal of Scientific Computing}. 

In this paper, we derive a viscous regularization for the non-equilibrium Seven-Equation two-phase flow Model. This regularization ensures positivity of the entropy 
residual and uniqueness of the weak solution, is consistent with the viscous regularization for Euler equations when one phase disappears, does not depend on the spatial discretization scheme chosen, and is compatible with the generalized Harten entropies. 

We investigate the behavior of the proposed viscous regularization for two important limit-cases: a five-equation two-phase flow model (obtained via a Chapman-Enskog expansion) and in the low-Mach asymptotic regime.


Numerical results are provided for a shock tube problem and a multi-Mach two-phase mixture flow problem (low Mach for liquid, supersonic for vapor).


This work follows prior works by Guermond \& Popov who proposed a viscous regularization for single-phase equations : ``Viscous regularization of the Euler equations and entropy principles'', {\it SIAM J. Appl. Math} 74 (2) (2014) 284-305.


Thank you for considering this manuscript for publication in the {\it Journal of Scientific Computing}.
