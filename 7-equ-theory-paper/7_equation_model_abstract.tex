In this paper, a viscous regularization is derived for the non-equilibrium Seven-Equation two-phase flow Model (SEM). 
This regularization is derived by the mean of an entropy condition that selects the physical or entropy weak solution.
\tcr{what is 'the' physical solution? is it unique? is there only one entropy solution? I think we shold be careful about the wording here}
The viscous regularization also ensures nonnegativity of the entropy residual \tcr{check}, is consistent with the viscous regularization for Euler equations 
when one phase disappears, does not depend on the spatial discretization scheme chosen, and is compatible with the generalized Harten entropies. 
We also investigate the behavior of the proposed viscous regularization for two theoretical limit-cases. 
First, a Chapman-Enskog expansion is performed for the regularized seven-equation two-phase flow model and we show that the five-equation flow 
model of Kapila is recovered with a well-scaled viscous regularization. 
Second, a low-Mach asymptotic limit of the regularized seven-equation flow model is carried out where the scaling of the non-dimensional numbers
associated with the viscous terms is determined such that an incompressible two-phase flow model, with a properly scaled regularization, is recovered. 
Both limit-cases are illustrated with one-dimensional numerical results including two-phase flow shock tube tests 
and two-phase flow steady-state solutions in a converging-diverging nozzle.
