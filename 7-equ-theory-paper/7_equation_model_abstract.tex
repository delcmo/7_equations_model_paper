In this paper, a viscous regularization is derived for the non-equilibrium Seven-Equation two-phase flow Model (SEM). This regularization ensures positivity of the entropy 
residual, uniqueness of the weak solution, is consistent with the viscous regularization for Euler equations when one phase disappears, does not depend on the spatial discretization scheme 
chosen, and is compatible with the generalized Harten entropies. We also investigate the behavior of the proposed viscous regularization for two 
theoretical limit-cases. First, a Chapman-Enskog expansion is performed for the regularized seven-equation two-phase flow model and we show that the five-equation flow 
model of Kapila is recovered with a well-scaled viscous regularization. Second, a low-Mach asymptotic limit of the regularized seven-equation flow model is carried out, 
yielding an incompressible two-phase flow model with a properly scaled regularization in the low-Mach regime. Both limit-cases are illustrated with one-dimensional numerical results.
