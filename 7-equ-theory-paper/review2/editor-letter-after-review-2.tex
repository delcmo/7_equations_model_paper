Thank you for the second round of reviews for our manuscript titled, 
``Viscous Regularization for the Non-equilibrium Seven-Equation Two-Phase Flow Model'', by 
by M. Delchini, J. Ragusa, and R. Berry, submitted for publication in the {\it  Springer Journal of Scientific Computing}. 

Our main interest lies
in enabling two-phase flow simulations for the seven-equation (two-pressure, two-velicity) model using {\bf continuous}
finite elements by employing an artificial viscosity technique based on entropy principles. To our knowledge, this has 
not been done to-date.

Comments from Reviewer \#1 (received as files \tcr{{\tt jsc\_2015\_2.pdf}} and \tcr{{\tt jsc\_2016\_1.pdf}}) 
were extremely insightful and allowed
us to fill in some gaps in the original version of the manuscript. For instance, this led us to add,
in the first revision, several sections
dealing with the theory of hyperbolic non-conservative systems of equations (HNCSE) as they apply to the 
Seven-Equation two-phase flow Model (SEM), notably (i) one full additional page in the Introduction and 
(ii) a new section, Section 3.1, on how the HNCSE theory applies to the proposed viscous regularization of the SEM.
The additional bibliography includes articles by R. Abgrall, Del Maso, Le Floch, Murat, Bianchini, Bressan. 
The reviewer also noted some incorrect wording of some statements, which we appropriately revised. A difficult shock 
tube test case, with almost pure phases on each side of the membrane, was request with a volume fraction of $0.01$. We
performed and added such a simulation, with an even lower volume fraction of $5\times 10{-4}$. 
Reviewer 1 found that our revised manuscript was {\it significantly improved in quality}, appreciated our inclusion of
theoretical backgournd on HNCSE, among others the proof of non-negative phase density and phasic volume.  On their
conclusions, they see our contribution as going beyond a simple extension of the work by Popov/Guermond for single-phase Euler equations. They {\bf strongly} recommend publication.

Comments from Reviewer \#2 were received as file \tcr{{\tt delchini\_ragusa\_berry.pdf}}
and as an inline note in the email following our first revision. This review is at odds with Reviewer \#1.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
In Reviewer \#2's first round of comments, 
they state that our work is {\it ``not good and is a poor extension of the work by Guermond and Popov''}. In our reply, we explain why we disagreed with this assessment (please see our first reply for details). 
\item In their second review, they thank us for our {\it substantial revision which highlight their motivations} but are now skeptical our the use of a artificial viscosity method.  They second review 
%
Our work is {\bf not} a simple extension to the viscous regularization by Guermond and Popov for Euler equations. 
The seven-equation model is a two-pressure and two-velocity
two-phase flow model of the Baer and Nunziato type. These models are strictly hyperbolic 
non-conservative system of equations (HNCSE); hyperbolicity being an important property with respect to
causality principle. However, this type of system involves many difficulties 
for the derivation of numerical methods, often rendering the Riemann problem determination complex due 
to the 7 waves presents (in 1D, more in multi-D).  {\bf We have provided an alternative 
numerical method, based on an artificial viscosity principles,} and we believe this is a valuable alternative for the
solution of such hyperbolic systems.
As aptly pointed out by Reviewer \#1, the seven-equation two-phase flow model is an hyperbolic non-conservative 
system of equations: classical results from the theory of conservation laws cannot be directly
applied to the present system and one needs to invoke the Del Maso-Le Floch-Murat extensions of the 
classical definitions of a weak solution and the entropy solution. Existence of a solution to
a problem in non-conservative form also need additional tools. Another obvious demonstration that our
work is not simple extension of the work by Guermond and Popov is the fact that the volume fraction equation
also needs a  viscous stabilization term and we propose one such definition. 
%
The improvement we make here also allows a correct Mach number scaling for applications to all-speed flows and
the novel formulation allows for an easier extension to arbitrary equations of state.
In addition, their remark \#4 regarding the entropy residual is wrong. 
We have not, however, completely dismissed their review as some of their observations were relevant and have revised
our manuscript accordingly. You can find our full reply to this review in the file \tcr{{\tt reviewer-2.pdf}}.

We believe that we have adequately addressed all of the Reviewer's questions and hope that our paper will be found 
suitable for publication.

%In our revision, we have addressed the issues raised by the
