\section{Compatibility of the viscous regularization for the seven-equation two-phase model with the generalized Harten entropies}\label{app:harden}
%
We investigate in this appendix whether the viscous regularization of the seven-equation two-phase model derived in \sct{sec:visc-regu} is compatible with some or all generalized entropies identified in Harten et al. \cite{Harten}. Considering the single-phase Euler equations, Harten et al. \cite{Harten} demonstrated that a function $\rho \mathscr{H}(s)$ is called a generalized entropy and is strictly concave if $\mathscr{H}$ is twice differential and
%
\begin{multline}\label{eq:generalized_ent}
\mathscr{H}' (s)  \geq 0, \ \ \ \ \mathscr{H}'(s)c_p^{-1} - \mathscr{H}'' \geq 0, \ \forall \left( \rho, e \right) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2 \ ,
\end{multline}
%
where $c_p \left( \rho, e \right) = T \partial_T s \left( \rho, e \right)$ is the specific heat at constant pressure ($T$ is a function of $e$ and $\rho$ through the equation of state). Because the seven-equation two-phase model was initially derived by assuming that each phase obeys the single-phase Euler equation, we want to investigate whether the above property still holds when considering the seven-equation model with viscous regularization included. To do so, we consider a phasic generalized entropy, $\mathscr{H}_k(s_k)$ and a phasic specific heat at constant pressure, $c_{p,k} \left( \rho_k, e_k \right) = T_k \partial_{T_k} s_k \left( \rho_k, T_k \right)$ characterized by \eqt{eq:generalized_ent}. The objective is to find an entropy inequality verified by $\rho_k \mathscr{H}_k(s_k)$.

We start from the entropy inequality verified by $s_k$, 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app}
\alpha_k \rho_k A \frac{Ds_k}{Dt} =  \mbold f_k \cdot \grad s_k + \div \left( \alpha_k A \rho_k \kappa_k  \grad s_k \right)  
- \alpha_k \rho_k A \kappa_k Q_k + (s_e)_k \alpha_k A \rho_k \mu_k \grad^s \mbold u_k : \grad \mbold u_k.
\end{equation}
%
%Recalling the definition of $f_k = \alpha_k A \kappa_k \grad \rho_k + A \rho_k \beta_k \grad \alpha_k $, 
\eqt{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app} is multiplied by $\mathscr{H}_k'(s_k)$ to yield:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app2}
\alpha_k \rho_k A \frac{D\mathscr{H}_k(s_k)}{Dt} &= \div \left( \alpha_k A \rho_k \kappa_k \grad \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) \right) - \mathscr{H}_k''(s_k) \alpha_k A \kappa_k \rho_k \| \grad s_k \|^2 + \nonumber\\
&\mathscr{H}_k'(s_k) \mbold f_k \cdot \grad s_k - \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k)\alpha_k \rho_k A \kappa_k Q_k + \nonumber \\
& \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k)(s_e)_k \alpha_k A \rho_k \mu_k \grad^s \mbold u_k : \grad \mbold u_k.
\end{align}
%
Let us now multiply the continuity equation of phase $k$ by $\mathscr{H}_k (s_k)$ and add the result to the above equation to obtain:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app3}
\partial_t \left( \alpha_k \rho_k A \mathscr{H}_k(s_k)\right) + \div \left( \alpha_k \rho_k \mbold u_k A \mathscr{H}_k(s_k) \right)  &- \nonumber\\
\div \left[ \alpha_k A \rho_k \kappa_k \grad \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) + \alpha_k A \kappa_k \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) \grad \rho_k  \right. & \left. + A \kappa_k \rho_k \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) \grad \alpha_k\right] = \nonumber \\
\underbrace{-\mathscr{H}_k''(s_k) \alpha_k A \kappa_k \rho_k \| \grad s_k \|^2  - \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k) \alpha_k A \kappa_k \rho_k  Q_k}_{\mathbb{T}_0} &+\nonumber \\
\underbrace{ \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k)(s_e)_k  \alpha_k A \rho_k \mu_k \grad^s \mbold u_k : \grad \mbold u_k}_{\mathbb{T}_1} & .
\end{align}
%
As in \sct{sec:visc-regu}, the left-hand side of \eqt{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app3} is split into two residuals denoted by $\mathbb{T}_0$ and $\mathbb{T}_1$ in order to study the sign of each of them. We start by studying the sign of $\mathbb{T}_1$ that is positive since it is assumed that $ \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k) \geq 0$. We now investigate the sign of $\mathbb{T}_0$. Using \eqt{eq:generalized_ent}, we have:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:new_quad_form}
- \mathbb{T}_0 \leq \mathscr{H}_k'(s_k) \alpha_k A \kappa_k \rho_k \left( c_{p,k}^{-1} \|\grad s_k\|^2 +  Q_k\right) \ .
\end{equation}
%
The right-hand side of \eqt{eq:new_quad_form} is a quadratic form that was already defined in Appendix 5 of \cite{jlg} and can be recast in the matrix form $X^t_k \mathbb{S} X_k$ where $\mathbb{S}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix and the vector $X_k$ was previously defined in \sct{sec:visc-regu}. In \cite{jlg}, matrix $\mathbb{S}$ is shown to be negative semi-definite which allows us to conclude that $\mathbb{T}_0$ is unconditionally positive using \eqt{eq:new_quad_form}. Then, knowing the sign of the two residuals $\mathbb{T}_0$ and $\mathbb{T}_1$, we conclude that:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:ent-res-7-eqn-diss-terms-app4}
\partial_t \left( \alpha_k \rho_k A \mathscr{H}_k(s_k)\right) + \div \left( \alpha_k \rho_k \mbold u_k A \mathscr{H}_k(s_k) \right)  &- \nonumber\\
\div \left[ \alpha_k A \rho_k \kappa_k \grad \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) + \alpha_k A \kappa_k \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) \grad \rho_k  \right. & \left. + A \kappa_k \rho_k \mathscr{H}_k (s_k) \grad \alpha_k\right] \geq 0 \ .\nonumber 
\end{align}
%
For there, we conclude that an entropy inequality is satisfied for all generalized entropies $\rho_k \mathscr{H}_k (s_k)$ when using the viscous regularization derived in \sct{sec:visc-regu} for the seven-equation two-phase model. Note that the above inequality holds for the total entropy of the system as well, i.e., when summing over the phases (the source terms are determined from rational thermodynamics that requires summations over the phases).
